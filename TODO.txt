 Unable to migrate to dependency-based boot system 

Tests have determined that problems in the boot system exist which prevent migration to dependency-based
 boot sequencing: 

insserv: warning: script 'K30alfresco340' missing LSB tags and overrides, insserv: warning: script
'K30alfresco' missing LSB tags and overrides, insserv: warning: script 'S93xwiki' missing LSB tags and
overrides, insserv: warning: script 'S78_cms8' missing LSB tags and overrides, insserv: warning: script
'cms8_start' missing LSB tags and overrides, insserv: warning: script 'alfresco' missing LSB tags and
overrides, insserv: warning: script 'alfresco340' missing LSB tags and overrides, , package apcupsd removed
but not purged, package gpm removed but not purged, package hal removed but not purged, package upsd removed
but not purged

If the reported problem is a local modification, it needs to be fixed manually. If it's a bug in the
package, it should be reported to the BTS and fixed in the package. See
http://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts/DependencyBasedBoot for more information about how to fix the problems
preventing migration.

To reattempt the migration process after the problems have been fixed, run "dpkg-reconfigure sysv-rc".
